# LEGAL DISCLAIMER:
This program is not intended to make accurate or correct predictions of future stock prices. Do not use this program to predict stock prices with the intent to actually buy or sell stocks. If you do so, you will be doing it at your own risk and will lose all your money.

This stock price predictor program was created for the final project of SAT4650 "Applied Computing in Python" during Spring 2023 at Michigan Technological University. 
The dataset I used for this program comes from https://stooq.com/db/h/ 
This program uses the XGBOOST regression algorithm to predict future stock prices.
